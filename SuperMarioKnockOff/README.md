# AI Project Fall 2018

## Installation
Ensure you have [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-pip-from-the-command-line) installed.

### Linux
```
$ git clone git@github.com:FallingSnow/AIProjectFall2018.git
$ cd AIProjectFall2018
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Windows
**TODO**

## Running
```
$ python3 main.py
```

#### Image sizes (pixels):
```
blocks are 50, 50
player is 20, 35
enemy 40, 30
```

If you want to quickly switch pictures change NAME in ("Images/NAME.png") to whatever the new picture name is. Also in main gf is `gameFunctions`, but it's shorten to make it easier to use.

### Pygame Tips:

All objects that are being displayed have a "rect".

You can use this to get several things:
```python
object.rect.x = (left pixel value)  #*can also use object.rect.left*
object.rect.right = (right pixel value)
object.rect.y = (top pixel value)   #*can also use object.rect.top*
object.rect.bottom = (bottom pixel value)
object.rect.width = (width of rect)
EXAMPLE1: block.rect.x = 50 (moves the block 50 pixels from the left of the screen)
EXAMPLE2: currentLocation = player.rect.y
```

You can change the location of objects by doing:
```python
objects.rect.y, objects.rect.x = 50, 100
    #*same as doing object.rect.y = 50
    #*              object.rect.x = 50
```

The objects that are included are: player, blocks (inside map)

The player is a bit different, if you want to move him, then you have to move `player.x` instead of `player.rect.x`.

"map" is a group of "blocks". For creating new blocks in map, it's easier to use a loop. You could also just code everyone individually:
```python
    newblock = Map(settings, screen) # Creates object
    newBlock.rect.x, newBlock.rect.y = 50, 50 # moved block to coordinate (50, 50)
    map.add(newBlock)  # Adds new block into the group for collide testing
```

**Enemy is not yet finished and is only going to be added if the spike doesn't seem like enough of a challenge.**

**As for as I know, pygame doesn't use triangles, so we'll create some kind of square killing device**

**If you want to mess around with the code, but don't know where to start, mess with settings.**
